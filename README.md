# spacerAQ_vh
Custom for analyzing data in Hoikkala et al. 2020. Currently for review purposes only.

The analysis can be run using the pipeline spacerpipeline_hoikkala_etal_2020.sh. However, several steps need to be taken before the run:

1. Install dependencies. The list of necessary dependencies are in the file environment.yml. The easiest way to install these is to create a new Anaconda environment with the command `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create a new conda environment named spacerAQ_vh_2020
